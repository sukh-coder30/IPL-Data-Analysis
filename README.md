# IPL-Data-Analysis
1. Project Overview

This project analyzes historical IPL (Indian Premier League) data to uncover insights about team performances, player achievements, match outcomes, and seasonal trends. The analysis is presented through interactive Power BI dashboards, allowing exploration by team, season, player, and venue.

2. Data Sources

Matches Dataset → match-level data (season, teams, toss, results, winner, venue, etc.)

Deliveries Dataset → ball-by-ball data (runs, wickets, dismissals, player stats, etc.)

3. Project Deliverables
Power BI Dashboard containing:

Top Performers → Leading run-scorers, wicket-takers, fielding stats.

Team Analysis → Wins, toss vs outcome, win margins.

Venue Insights → Matches per city, lucky stadiums, venue influence.

Seasonal Trends → Winners by season, scoring trends, toss decisions.

Analytical Report with actionable insights and recommendations.

4. Dashboard Components
A. Top Performers

Cards → Top run scorer, top wicket taker.

Bar Charts → Top 10 run scorers, top 10 wicket takers.

Table → Economy Rate + Wickets.

Bar Charts → Most Sixes/Fours, Most Catches/Run-outs.

Key Insights

Virat Kohli & David Warner consistently lead batting charts.

Lasith Malinga & Dwayne Bravo dominate in wickets.

AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle → highest six hitters.

Suresh Raina → top fielder in catches.

B. Team Analysis

Wins & Win% → Bar chart comparing teams across seasons.

Toss vs Match Outcome → Clustered column showing toss win % vs match win %.

Runs vs Wickets Margin → Histogram comparing win_by_runs vs win_by_wickets.

Key Insights

Mumbai Indians & Chennai Super Kings → most successful teams.

Toss advantage is small, but choosing to chase after toss shows higher win%.

Majority of wins come by wickets (successful chases) rather than defending runs.

C. Venue Insights

Matches Hosted → Bar chart: City/venue-wise.

Lucky Venues → Heatmap linking venue with team win% (home advantage).

Batting/Bowling Outcomes → Average runs & wickets per venue.

Key Insights

Eden Gardens, Wankhede, Chinnaswamy → hosted maximum matches.

Wankhede favors high scores, while Chepauk is more bowler-friendly.

Teams often perform better at their home stadiums.

D. Seasonal Trends

Winners by Year → Table with season & champion team.

Scoring Trends → Line chart (avg. runs/match, sixes/fours per season).

Toss Decisions Trend → Stacked column (batting vs fielding after toss).

Key Insights

Champions vary but CSK & MI dominate finals.

Avg. runs per match have gradually increased → T20 becoming more batting-friendly.

Toss decisions have shifted → early years (batting first), recent years (fielding first).

5. Recommendations

Teams should prioritize strong batting finishers as chasing success rate is high.

Bowlers with strong death-over economy (like Bumrah, Bravo) are critical in high-scoring venues.

Home Advantage plays a significant role → teams should leverage local pitch knowledge.

Toss Strategy → Choosing to field first has proven more effective in recent seasons.

6. Final Deliverables

Power BI Dashboard → interactive exploration.

PDF Report → summary of findings (can export visuals + insights).

Data Dictionary → mapping of columns used (matches, deliveries).
